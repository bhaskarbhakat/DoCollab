# DoCollab

```If you're looking for an alternative to Google Docs real-time collaboration, you are in right place.```

```
DoCollab is very similar to Google Docs.
Any number of users can edit the same document at the same time.
```

To collaborate with your colleagues or friends all you have to do is to share the link. Each time you load the page, a special document ID gets attached to the URL. Each document ID and its content stays active for 24 hours after the creation of link, so you do not immediately lose your content.

```Also, there isn't a limit for the number of collaborators!```
